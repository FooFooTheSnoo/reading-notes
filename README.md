# Joshua Hahn

 Hi, my name is Josh learning to code while I work as an office administrator. I am planning on using my education from CodeFellows to get into the tech industry. I do not know which path I will be taking once I'm there, so I'm looking forward to exploring all the options available. My CodeFellows 401 course I will be taking is FullStack Javascript.

I created this website to catalog my progression and practice creating on a platform.
